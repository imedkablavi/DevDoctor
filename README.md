<p align="center">
  <strong>Diagnose broken Linux developer workstations before changing them.</strong>
</p>

DevDoctor inspects the Linux workstation you already have, finds missing or broken developer tooling, explains package-manager and PATH conflicts, compares project requirements with the tools actually installed, and builds distro-aware repair or install plans that are previewed before execution.

It does not replace your package manager or environment manager. The goal is specific: identify what is wrong, show the local evidence, and produce the safest supported next step.

Scans are read-only. Project manifests are parsed without executing project hooks or scripts. Mutating commands require an explicit apply path and confirmation. When ownership or host policy is ambiguous, DevDoctor refuses instead of guessing.

## Demo

The demo is generated from real command output. See [assets/screenshots](assets/screenshots/README.md) for regeneration notes.

## Example

```text
$ devdoctor check --profile devops --missing

DevDoctor  v1.2.0rc1          4 installed  7 missing  2 warnings  0 broken
Linux developer workstation bootstrap

Host
OS             Fedora Linux 42        Arch        x86_64
Shell          bash                   Desktop     GNOME
Session        wayland                Terminal    xterm-256color
Managers       dnf, flatpak, pip      PATH issues 1

Containers

  Repair: Docker daemon is not running
  Verify: docker info

DevOps
✗ kubectl                                     sudo dnf install kubernetes-client
✗ Helm                                        sudo dnf install helm
✗ Terraform                                   sudo dnf install terraform
```

Typical findings include Docker daemon failures, missing runtime dependencies, broken executable symlinks, duplicate PATH installations, conflicting package managers, missing Git identity, incomplete Android/Flutter tooling, Java without `JAVA_HOME`, Python without working pip, and user-space binaries that are not exported into PATH.

## Install

DevDoctor requires Python 3.11 or newer.

The product name is **DevDoctor**. The console command is **`devdoctor`**. The Python distribution prepared for publication is **`devdoctor-workstation`**.

> `devdoctor-cli` is not this project's distribution name. Do not use it to install or update this repository.

### Current repository build

Until the first `devdoctor-workstation` PyPI release is published and verified, install directly from this repository:

```bash
python -m pip install "git+https://github.com/imedkablavi/DevDoctor.git"
devdoctor --version
```

For development:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/imedkablavi/DevDoctor.git
cd DevDoctor
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

A PyPI Trusted Publishing workflow is prepared for tagged releases. The README intentionally does not advertise `pip install devdoctor-workstation` until the public PyPI project has been created, published, and verified.

The Homebrew formula is also release-readiness work. Do not rely on a Homebrew install command until a tap exists and its clean installation CI passes.

## Quick start

```bash
devdoctor
devdoctor check --profile general
devdoctor check git docker node
devdoctor project .
devdoctor search docker
devdoctor repair docker
devdoctor diagnostics --stdout
devdoctor support --stdout
devdoctor manager-conflicts
devdoctor path-conflicts git python node
```

Preview installation work without changing the machine:

```bash
devdoctor install git docker --dry-run
devdoctor install --profile devops
```

Execute only after reviewing the plan:

```bash
devdoctor install --profile frontend --apply
```

## Project-aware preflight

A workstation can look healthy globally and still be wrong for the repository in front of you. `devdoctor project` reads supported declarative manifests and compares their requirements with the detected toolchain.

```text
$ devdoctor project .
DevDoctor project check: example-service
Sources: pyproject.toml, package.json
READY    python     found=3.13.7 required=>=3.12 source=pyproject.toml
MISMATCH node       found=20.19.0 required=>=22 source=package.json
MISSING  pnpm       found=not found required=9.15.0 source=package.json
```

The example shows output shape only. Project diagnosis supports selected evidence from `pyproject.toml`, `package.json`, `.tool-versions`, mise files, `Cargo.toml`, `go.mod`, `devbox.json`, language version files, Docker/Compose manifests, `Gemfile`, `composer.json`, and common Java build manifests.

It never evaluates project shell code or manifest-defined scripts. Symlinked supported manifests are not followed and each parsed file is bounded to 1 MB. Unsupported version expressions become `unknown` instead of being guessed.

For CI or onboarding:

```bash
devdoctor project . --json
```

During gradual adoption:

```bash
devdoctor project . --json --no-fail
```

See [Project-aware diagnostics](docs/PROJECT_DIAGNOSTICS.md) for the exact evidence and comparison contract.

## Better bug reports

`devdoctor support` converts the privacy-scrubbed diagnostic snapshot into Markdown that can be reviewed and pasted into a GitHub issue:

```bash
devdoctor support --stdout
devdoctor support --output devdoctor-support.md
```

The report intentionally omits hostname, username, raw PATH values, arbitrary environment values, shell history, and credentials. Session/shell values are normalized to small allowlists. Package and version names may still be sensitive, so review the report before publishing it.

The repository bug-report form asks for this report when available and requests `devdoctor project . --json --no-fail` for project-specific failures.

For each tool DevDoctor can record installed state, executable path, parsed version, package ownership where the host can prove it, inferred installation method, configuration locations, dependency state, health, repair recommendations, and an install plan when a safe mapping exists.

Detection support is not the same as mutation support. See [distribution support evidence](docs/SUPPORTED_DISTROS.md) for the distinction between fixtures, clean-wheel checks, container integration, and real-workstation evidence.

## Fedora Atomic and Bazzite

Image-based Fedora derivatives need different rules from mutable Fedora. DevDoctor records an Atomic-host classification once in the inventory context from release evidence such as Bazzite identity, known Atomic variants, image identity, or OSTree version data.

The planner suppresses DNF host mutation on confirmed Fedora Atomic/Bazzite systems even when a `dnf` executable is present. Merely having an `rpm-ostree` executable on an otherwise mutable Fedora workstation is not sufficient to classify the host as Atomic.

Where mappings exist, the planner prefers appropriate user-space/package-scoped tooling first and uses rpm-ostree layering only as a host fallback. Synthetic Atomic/Bazzite container tests validate policy only. They are not presented as real workstation or hardware compatibility testing.

## Repair and rollback

Ordinary `repair` is advisory. `repair-apply` only exposes repair actions that include an executable command and a known rollback command. It previews by default and requires `--apply` before execution.

Applied actions are recorded in a transaction journal. `repair-rollback` requires the transaction ID, validates persisted rollback commands against a bounded allowlist, previews them, and requires a separate apply decision.

## PATH and package ownership

The PATH analyzer reports empty entries, duplicates, missing directories, non-searchable directories, common user binary directories that are not exported, and shadowed executables.

`path-conflicts` adds bounded version and package-ownership probes for duplicate executable names. `uninstall` uses a stricter rule: it refuses removal unless the executable owner can be matched to the catalog package. On Atomic systems, RPM ownership by itself is not considered proof that a package was rpm-ostree layered.

## Diagnostics and privacy

```bash
devdoctor diagnostics --stdout | python -m json.tool
devdoctor diagnostics --output devdoctor-diagnostics.json
devdoctor support --stdout
```

The support snapshot intentionally omits hostname, username, raw PATH values, arbitrary environment values, and secret/token values. Session type and shell name are normalized instead of copying arbitrary environment strings. Review diagnostic files before sharing them because package and version names can still reveal local environment details.

## Export formats

```bash
devdoctor --json > inventory.json
devdoctor --json-file inventory.json
devdoctor --markdown-file inventory.md
devdoctor --html-file inventory.html
devdoctor export json --output inventory.json
devdoctor export markdown --output inventory.md
```

JSON is the machine-readable inventory format. Markdown is useful for issues, handoffs, and onboarding notes. HTML is a standalone local report.

## Safety model

- Scans, search, diagnostics, support-report generation, conflict analysis, project diagnosis, and ordinary repair inspection are read-only.
- Project diagnosis does not execute hooks, package scripts, shell fragments, or version-manager activation commands.
- Symlinked supported project manifests are not followed and parsed manifests are size-bounded.
- DevDoctor does not use `shell=True` for its planned command execution path.
- Install, update, uninstall, cache cleanup, self-update, repair application, and rollback are preview-first.
- `--apply` is required for supported mutation paths.
- Confirmation remains enabled unless the user explicitly passes `--yes`.
- Confirmed Fedora Atomic/Bazzite host planning does not fall back to DNF mutation.
- Atomic planning prefers mapped user-space/package-scoped managers before rpm-ostree layering.
- Ambiguous package ownership causes uninstall to refuse rather than select a package manager by guesswork.
- Executed operations are recorded as structured JSON Lines in the user state directory.
- Verification commands run after successful operations when the plan provides one.
- Diagnostics are designed not to export secrets, credentials, shell history, hostname, username, or raw environment values.

## Architecture

  Planner --> Executor[Confirmed subprocess execution]
  Executor --> Verify[Verification + operation log]
```

The bootstrap model is centered on `ToolSpec`, `ToolDetection`, `InstallPlan`, `BootstrapProfile`, and `BootstrapInventory`. The current release candidate also has a conservative compatibility layer around older planners and mutating callbacks. Moving those policies into one central planner/executor API remains architecture cleanup work.

## Plugin catalog

Third-party packages can add bootstrap tools through the `devdoctor.bootstrap_tools` entry-point group.

```toml
[project.entry-points."devdoctor.bootstrap_tools"]
mytools = "my_package.devdoctor:get_tools"
```

Plugin detectors should be fast, local, non-destructive, and safe to run without root privileges.

## Release verification

The `v1.2.0rc1` release pipeline is designed to build the Python distributions once, validate the clean wheel, generate `SHA256SUMS` and an SPDX 2.3 SBOM, create provenance/SBOM attestations, and then reuse those tested artifacts for GitHub Release and optional PyPI Trusted Publishing.

Expected release payload:

```text
devdoctor_workstation-1.2.0rc1-py3-none-any.whl
devdoctor_workstation-1.2.0rc1.tar.gz
devdoctor-install.sh
devdoctor.spdx.json
SHA256SUMS
```

PyPI publication remains disabled until the external Trusted Publisher for `devdoctor-workstation` and the protected `pypi` environment are configured. See [release distribution readiness](docs/RELEASE_DISTRIBUTION.md) and [v1.2.0rc1 release notes](docs/RELEASE_NOTES_v1.2.0rc1.md).

## Development

```bash
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
ruff format --check .
ruff check .
pytest
python -m devdoctor --quiet
python -m devdoctor --json | python -m json.tool
```

When changing package mappings, package identity, manifest parsing, or safety policy, add deterministic positive and negative tests. When changing CLI output, verify terminal output and machine-readable JSON.

## Roadmap

- Qualify and publish the release candidate after the final commit passes the full matrix.
- Configure the external PyPI Trusted Publisher for `devdoctor-workstation` and protected GitHub `pypi` environment.
- Publish and validate a Homebrew tap instead of advertising a future command prematurely.
- Move temporary runtime policy overrides into a single central planner/executor architecture.
- Expand real-workstation evidence for Atomic/Bazzite and other advertised environments.
- Expand project-aware parsing only through bounded formats and regression fixtures; do not execute project configuration.
- Add more verified distro package mappings through contribution fixtures.
- Publish an external plugin example and stable bootstrap/project JSON schema documentation.

## FAQ

**Does DevDoctor install packages by default?**  
No. Inventory and planning are read-only. A supported mutation requires an explicit apply path.

**Does `devdoctor project` replace mise, Devbox, Nix, containers, or another environment manager?**  
No. Those tools can remain the project's source of truth. DevDoctor only diagnoses whether the current workstation matches the declarative requirements it can safely understand.

**Why not show one workstation score?**  
A workstation is only ready relative to the project in front of it. DevDoctor reports concrete installed, missing, warning, broken, and project-mismatch states instead of hiding them behind one score.

**Can I use it in CI or onboarding scripts?**  
Yes. `devdoctor verify --profile general --quiet` checks a profile; `devdoctor project . --json` checks supported repository requirements; `devdoctor --json` gives structured inventory data.

**Does it support non-Linux systems?**  
No. DevDoctor is intentionally Linux-first.
