# Release distribution readiness

## Distribution identity

The DevDoctor product and console command remain `DevDoctor` and `devdoctor`.

The Python distribution used for publication is **`devdoctor-workstation`**. The previously planned name `devdoctor-cli` is already used by another public project and must not be used by this repository for PyPI publishing, self-update, installer metadata, or release documentation.

## Release payload

A qualified tagged release is designed to build one release payload and reuse it for every publication destination:

- source distribution (`.tar.gz`)
- Python wheel (`.whl`)
- `devdoctor-install.sh`
- SPDX 2.3 SBOM (`devdoctor.spdx.json`)
- `SHA256SUMS`

For `v1.2.0rc1`, the normalized Python artifacts must be:

```text
devdoctor_workstation-1.2.0rc1-py3-none-any.whl
devdoctor_workstation-1.2.0rc1.tar.gz
```

The release workflow validates formatting, lint, tests, package metadata, expected distribution filenames, and a clean wheel installation before the payload is uploaded.

The tag name is also checked against the package version. A tag such as `v1.2.0rc1` must point at code whose package version is exactly `1.2.0rc1`.

## Build once, publish the tested artifacts

The wheel and sdist are created in the release `build` job. That same job:

1. validates the built distributions,
2. validates the normalized `devdoctor_workstation` filenames,
3. installs the wheel into a new virtual environment,
4. runs CLI and self-update smoke checks,
5. creates the SBOM and checksum manifest,
6. creates provenance and SBOM attestations,
7. uploads the complete payload as a GitHub Actions artifact, and
8. creates the GitHub Release for tag-triggered runs.

The PyPI job downloads that exact Actions artifact. It does not rebuild the package.

## PyPI Trusted Publishing

The package name is `devdoctor-workstation` and the console command is `devdoctor`.

PyPI publishing is intentionally disabled until external setup is complete. A tag-triggered release publishes to PyPI only when the repository variable below is set:

```text
PYPI_TRUSTED_PUBLISHING_ENABLED=true
```

Before enabling it:

1. Create or configure the `devdoctor-workstation` project/pending publisher on PyPI.
2. Add a Trusted Publisher for `imedkablavi/DevDoctor`.
3. Set the workflow to `.github/workflows/release.yml`.
4. Set the GitHub environment name to `pypi`.
5. Create/protect the `pypi` environment in GitHub with the desired reviewer policy.
6. Run the release workflow without a publication-enabled tag and inspect the generated package artifacts.
7. Confirm the PyPI project metadata points to this repository.
8. Enable the repository variable only when the external publisher configuration is correct.

Do not configure a Trusted Publisher or API token for `devdoctor-cli`; that name belongs to another project. Do not add a long-lived PyPI API token for this release path.

## Install script

`scripts/install.sh` performs a user-space installation using a dedicated virtual environment. It does not invoke `sudo` and refuses a non-interactive install unless `--yes` is explicitly supplied.

The generic script uses `devdoctor-workstation` for PyPI installs. The tagged release workflow produces a release-specific copy that defaults to the GitHub source and exact release version.

For a downloaded tagged release asset:

```sh
sh devdoctor-install.sh
```

For automation where the caller has already approved the change:

```sh
sh devdoctor-install.sh --yes
```

The generic GitHub source mode is valid only after the requested GitHub Release exists:

```sh
sh scripts/install.sh --source github --version 1.2.0rc1
```

Before a GitHub or PyPI release exists, install a development checkout directly from the repository instead of using a release installer.

The GitHub source downloads the exact `devdoctor_workstation-<version>-py3-none-any.whl` file and `SHA256SUMS`, verifies the wheel, installs into a versioned user-owned environment, and repoints the command symlink only after a successful install. Previous version directories are retained for manual rollback.

## Checksums

Release consumers can verify the local payload with:

```sh
sha256sum --check SHA256SUMS
```

`SHA256SUMS` is generated from a sorted list of release files and does not include itself.

A checksum manifest proves byte integrity relative to the manifest. It does not by itself prove who produced the artifact.

## Provenance and SBOM attestations

The public release workflow uses `actions/attest` with GitHub OIDC to create keyless attestations for the release payload.

The workflow creates:

- build provenance for the release artifact checksums, and
- an SBOM attestation that binds `devdoctor.spdx.json` to the wheel and sdist.

For a downloaded release artifact, GitHub CLI can be used to verify a repository attestation:

```sh
gh attestation verify devdoctor_workstation-1.2.0rc1-py3-none-any.whl \
  --repo imedkablavi/DevDoctor
```

The SPDX file describes the DevDoctor distribution and its declared direct runtime dependencies. It is generated deterministically from package metadata and release artifact hashes; it does not claim to be a full operating-system or transitive dependency inventory.

## Homebrew readiness

The repository contains a formula readiness template, not a published Homebrew distribution channel.

Do not advertise `brew install ...` until all of the following are true:

- a real tap repository exists,
- release URLs are immutable,
- SHA-256 hashes match the final tagged artifacts,
- Python resources are handled correctly for the formula strategy, and
- a clean Homebrew CI job installs and runs `devdoctor --version` successfully.

## Release candidate policy

`v1.2.0rc1` is a prerelease. GitHub Release is configured to mark tags containing `rc` as prereleases.

Promotion to a stable `v1.2.0` requires the current commit's full CI/release qualification, review of release-candidate feedback, and no unresolved high-severity mutation, package-manager-selection, installer, self-update, or distribution-identity regression.
